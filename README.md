# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

## Bug

The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement. Next.js requires all page components to return a React element.  Without it, the component renders nothing, and in some cases, this could throw errors.

## Solution

The `pages/aboutSolution.js` file provides the corrected code, adding the necessary `return` statement to render a simple JSX element.  This ensures the component functions correctly.
